The heatmap is accessible through choosing ‘Drug-cancer ssociation heatmap’ under navigation mark ‘Drug-cancer association’. It records the connectivity scores of 107x1343 combinations of small molecules and cancer diseases. High drug potential is in blue and low drug potential is in red.

Users can hover the cursor over any place in the heatmap and will see the connectivity score of a drug to treat a certain disease. For example, **Figure 1** shows a connectivity score of -1 of anabasine to treat lung cancer.
